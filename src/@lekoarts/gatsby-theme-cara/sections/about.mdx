## About Me


I have previously studied astrophysics, GIS and a little Java, and worked as a counselor for young people with autism for many years. Now I have finally found my calling and switched paths to become a front end developer. In my free time I like to hang out with my girlfriend, cook, play board games, watch movies and hang out with friends.
